    elif operator == '-':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operator == '*':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operator == '/':
        if num2 != 0:
            return num1 / num2
        else:
            return "Error: Division by zero"
    else:
        return "Error: Invalid operator"

# Test
print(calculator(10, 5, '+'))  # Output: 15

# Test
account = SavingsAccount("12345", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(f"Balance: {account.get_balance()}")  # Balance: 1500

### Question 13 (15 points)
Implement polymorphism with a Shape hierarchy.

**Sample Solution:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import math

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius

# Polymorphism in action
def print_shape_info(shape):
    print(f"Area: {shape.area():.2f}")
    print(f"Perimeter: {shape.perimeter():.2f}")

# Test
shapes = [Rectangle(5, 3), Circle(4)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(f"{shape.__class__.__name__}:")
    print_shape_info(shape)
```
